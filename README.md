# Code-a-Pookalam

🌸 Pookalam with Python Turtle 🐢


A vibrant Onam Pookalam (floral rangoli) created with Python’s turtle graphics.This vibrant digital Pookalam was crafted using Python's Turtle graphics module, blending traditional Kerala aesthetics with geometric precision. The design features concentric rings, floral bursts, diamond motifs, and radial dot patterns all layered in harmonious symmetry.
Celebrate the colors of tradition, culture, and creativity right from your terminal! 🎨✨


# Why Turtle?

Because turtles are slow, but this one’s fast.

Python’s Turtle module lets us draw with precision, color, and flair—perfect for mimicking the layered beauty of real Pookalams.

Plus, it’s built-in. No pip installs. No drama.


# Features

# Inspiration

The project celebrates Onam, Kerala’s harvest festival 🌾.
The Pookalam (floral carpet) is a symbol of unity, joy, and tradition.


# Behind the Scenes

This project is powered by:

- Trigonometry: For petal placement and radial symmetry
- Loops: Because flowers have layers
- Kerala nostalgia: Every arc and dot is a tribute to tradition
- AKASH’s obsession with visual harmony: You’ll see it in the color balance and outline precision


# Credits
Crafted with love by AKASH VINOD

A proud Keralite blending tradition, geometry, and code.


# Bonus: What is Onam?

Onam is Kerala’s harvest festival, celebrated with boat races, feasts, dances, and—you guessed it—Pookalams.

This project is a digital tribute to that spirit.

No flowers were harmed in the making of this code.
